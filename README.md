# Maze-path-solver-DFS

The problem is to provide a solution path to the maze with Depth First Search algorithm.

As specified,

The problem specifications:

Initial position for all the multiple mazes that read is the point "(0,0)"

Goal is to reach the max point "(N-1, M-1)", where N and M corresponds to the height and width of the maze.

The multiple mazes will be read from the file that is provided in the drive file shared with you

The maze consists of 0s and 1s which 0s indicate a clear path and 1s indicate a wall that can not be moved

To reach to the goal, you are required to provide a path consist of clear roads(0s)

The reading and converting the path to the desired outputs have already been implemented which you CANNOT change in order to get full credits

The exact outputs that your function expected to provide are printed it in the last code block given the expected output file.

You need the provide the required function(s) that finds the path from initial position to the goal position using Depth First Search, which you may implement it with stack or recursively as you wish.
